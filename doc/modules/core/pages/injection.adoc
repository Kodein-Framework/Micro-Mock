= Injecting your test classes

Instead of manually creating your own mocks & fakes, it can be useful to inject them in your test class, especially if you have multiple tests using them.

[source,kotlin]
----
@UsesFakes(User::class)
class MyTests {
    @Mock lateinit var db: Database
    @Mock lateinit var api: API

    @Fake lateinit var user: User

    lateinit var controller: Controller

    val mocker = Mocker()

    @BeforeTest fun setUp() {
        mocker.reset() //<1>
        this.injectMocks(mocker) //<2>
        controller = ControllerImpl(db, api) //<3>
    }

    @Test fun controllerTest() {
        mocker.every { view.render(isAny()) } returns true
        controller.start()
        mocker.verify { view.render(model) }
    }
}
----
<1> Resets the mocker before any test (which removes all mocked behaviour & logged calls), so that each test gets a "clean" mocker.
<2> Injects mocks and fakes.
<3> Create classes to be tested with injected mocks & fakes.

As soon as a class `T` contains a `@Mock` or `@Fake` annotated property, a `T.injectMocks(Mocker)` function will be created by the processor.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to `reset` the `Mocker` in a `@BeforeTest` method!
