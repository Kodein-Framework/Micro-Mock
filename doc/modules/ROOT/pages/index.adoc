= MocKMP

A Kotlin/Multiplatform Kotlin Symbol Processor that generates Mocks & Fakes at compile-time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
- Mocking only applies to *interfaces*
- Faking only applies to *concrete trees*

A Mock is an object implementing an interface whose behaviour is configurable at run-time, usually specifically for unit-tests. +
Mocks can be used to validate that a method or property was (or wasn't) accessed in specific conditions.

A fake is a concrete class that contains bogus data: all nullables are null, all strings are empty, all numbers are 0. +
A fake can be used when you need to instantiate a class to test an API but do not care about the data it contains.
