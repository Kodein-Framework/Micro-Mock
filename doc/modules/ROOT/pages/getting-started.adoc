= Getting started

1. Apply the Gradle plugin and activate the helper dependency:
+
[source,kotlin,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
plugins {
    kotlin("multiplatform")
    id("org.kodein.mock.mockmp") version "{version}"
}

kotlin {
    // Your Koltin/Multiplatform configuration
}

mockmp {
    usesHelper = true
    installWorkaround()
}
----

2. Create a test class that declares injected mocks and fakes:
+
[source,kotlin]
----
class MyTest : TestsWithMocks() {
    override fun setUpMocks() = injectMocks(mocker) //<1>

    @Mock lateinit var view: View
    @Fake lateinit var model: Model

    val controller by withMocks { Controller(view = view, firstModel = model) }

    @Test fun controllerTest() {
        every { view.render(isAny()) } returns true
        controller.start()
        verify { view.render(model) }
    }
}
----
<1> This is mandatory and cannot be generated. You need to run the KSP generation at least once for your IDE to see the `injectMocks` generated function.
+
NOTE: Every property annotated by `@Mock`, annotated by `@Fake` or delegated to `withMocks` will be reset fresh between each test.
